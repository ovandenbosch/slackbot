# Slackbot

Using the slack developer api, we are able to make a 'Slack app' to automate some cool features.

## Features ðŸ”¥
- Ability to count how many messages there has been in the channel
- Ability to post a random fact using a fact API

## Usage
- To use this project yourself, you will first need to sign up for a slack developer account for free and get a token and secret.
  - These will need to be loaded into the .env file
- Then you will need to install ngrok and configure it to point to port 80
- You will then need to copy the url that ngrok provides you with and place the url in the slack devleoper profile
- You will then need to create a slack app in the developer management system
- Finally start using your bot!!
